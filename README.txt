# Instagram Username Availability Checker

## Introduction
This script allows you to generate random Instagram usernames and check their availability by sending HTTP requests to the corresponding profile pages. It utilizes the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, the `random` module to generate random usernames, and the `colorama` library to add color to the console output.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `colorama` library 
## Usage
1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
	pip install requests
	pip install colorama
4. Run the script using the following command:
	python main.py
5. The script will start generating random usernames and checking their availability on Instagram.
6. The console output will indicate whether a username is found or not found.
7. The script will pause for 2 seconds between each request to comply with rate limits.

## Notes
- This script is for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly.
- It's important to comply with Instagram's terms of service and any applicable rate limits.
- The accuracy of determining username availability may vary due to changes in Instagram's website structure or policies.
